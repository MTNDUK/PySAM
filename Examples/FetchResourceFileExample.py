"""
This example script shows how to fetch National Solar Resource Database (NSRDB)
and Wind ToolKit (WTK) data from NREL's developer network using the FetchResourceFiles()
class within `PySAM.ResourceTools`.

Resource data is saved to disk, within the `data/PySAM Downloaded Weather Files` directory by default,
and relative file paths to the saved files are returned.

For wind data, an additional step is taken to convert the wind toolkit output into the .srw
format PySAM expects.
